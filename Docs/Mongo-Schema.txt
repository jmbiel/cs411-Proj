Collection - Nightlife_Reccomendation.search_terms:
    This collection logs the searches that users enter. Normally we would make an API call to yelp to grab the
    businesses that are associated with the search term, however we cache the searches so that we can grab them
    from the database (this is quicker than making an API call). 

The following is the schema:
{
    "term" : "search_term" //KEY and Required field
    "response" : { //required field
        "business_name"
    }
}

Collection - Nightlife_Reccomendation.reviews:
    This collections logs the restaurant/club/bar reviews that our users will search for. Normally we would
    make an API call to grab these reviews, however since we cache them we may be able to grab them from our
    database rather than calling the API.

The following is the schema:
{
    "business" : "name" // KEY and Required field 
    "response" : { //required field
        "reviews": []
    }
}
