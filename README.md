# CS 411 Project -- Spring 2018

## Group Members:
    1. Nico Bermudez
    2. Zirui Liu
    3. Max Biel
    4. Rahul Jain

## Project Ideas:
### 1) Nightlife Recommendations:
    Goal: Reccommend bars, restaurants, clubs to a user based on his/her location and preferences which include serveral factors:
        1. Likeliness of crowd
        2. Likeliness of line
        3. Reviews

    How: Utilize uber movement data to determine which places are in highly frequented areas. Use yelp API to access reviews - potentially do lexical analysis to look for key words that the user prefers.  Use Boston public dataset of all bars, restuarants, and clubs - this is a static dataset that may be used for join operations at some point in the development of the project.
